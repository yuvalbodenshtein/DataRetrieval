Data Retrieval Project WikiPassages 
Report Data Retrieval : We have written our project in java using NetBeans. 
We put inside our project the json files of samples and tsv of test, so to read them we put the JSON jar inside our project. 
We hesitated what model to use (Probablistic, Vector, Language Model), and then decided to build inverted Index and retrieve according to BM25 formula. 
In order to implement we looped over all documents in the file, in inner loop   over all passages In each document as pre-processing. To text-process each passage, we downloaded the English stop-words list that are most popular according to zip distribution but do not say something about the uniqueness of the passage. So after tokenizing the text, splitting and omitting punctuations, we got a list of words, so we created a class named Inverted Index, which held our inverted index and helped us to compute statistics about each passage, like term frequency, document length and so on. 
For each term, if it already exists In the Index implemented by Java HashTable, we just concatenate to its linked list of << passage_id, document_id>, score> our passage_id, document_id.  and each time we met the word again, that means if the word already has in its linked list our passage_id we just update the score counter by +1. 
We used get functions to retrieve features like term total frequency, or passage's containing document length, and so on.   
For the Query Parsing, we actually used the same technique of splitting into words, for us suck we did not have enough idea of how to actually match between  a question word of how for example to words describing processes or actions.
We used Java HashTable to contain our candidates to be relevant passages, using Passage Class. The objects of Passages were already created in Pre – Processing existing in the java environment. For each word in query, we inserted its linked list, giving initial score according to the BM25 referencing a term and a document. 
For each word or that we either added a passage that may be relevant or add score to already candidate passage. Passages that no query terms were inside were ignored for that query.
Finally, after not a lot of debugging we played a little with the fomula to get even more relevant passages.
